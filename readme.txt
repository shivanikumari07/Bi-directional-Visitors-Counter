--------------------------Implementation of the project------------------------------------
The implementation of the bi-directional visitor counter project involves both hardware and
software components working together

Hardware Implementation:-
1. IR Sensors:
Install two IR sensors at appropriate locations to detect the presence of visitors. One sensor
is dedicated to tracking incoming visitors, while the other sensor tracks outgoing visitors.

2. Relay Module:
Connect the relay module to the ESP266 module to control the visitor count. The relay
module enables incrementing or decrementing the count based on the sensor inputs.

3. Display:
Connect a display, such as an LED or LCD screen, to the ESP266 module to show the realtime visitor count.


------------------------------Software Implementation---------------------------------------
1. rogramming:
Use a suitable programming language like Arduino IDE or C++ to program the ESP266
module. Write code to receive input from the IR sensors and control the relay module
accordingly.

2. Sensor Interfacing:
Configure the ESP266 module to read data from the IR sensors and interpret the signals to
identify incoming and outgoing visitors accurately.

3. Visitor Count Logic:
Implement the logic in the code to increment the count when an incoming visitor is
detected and decrement the count when an outgoing visitor is detected.
Display Update: Write code to update the display with the current visitor count in real-time.

3. Cloud Connectivity:
Blynk Integration:
Utilize Blynk software to establish cloud connectivity. Set up the ESP266 module to
communicate with the Blynk platform using Wi-Fi or other appropriate means.
Data Upload:
Program the ESP266 module to periodically send the visitor count data to the cloud using
Blynk APIs or libraries.

4. Cloud Monitoring:
Access the Blynk dashboard or mobile application to remotely monitor and analyze the
visitor count data in real-time. Generate reports or visualize the data as per your
requirements.
